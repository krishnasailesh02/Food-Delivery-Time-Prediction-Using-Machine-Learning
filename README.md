# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning


In this project, we aim to predict real-time food delivery times by leveraging Machine Learning techniques. The process involves calculating the distance between the food preparation point (restaurant) and the customer's location. By analyzing historical delivery data, we identify patterns and relationships between the distance traveled and the time taken by delivery partners for similar distances.

This approach mirrors the methods used by leading food delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy, which ensure transparency by accurately estimating delivery times based on past performance data. This project demonstrates how to implement a Machine Learning model in Python to provide accurate delivery time predictions, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
